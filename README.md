## About the Video Course
Learn to craft websites that provide an optimal viewing experience on any device using HTML5. We will walk you through Responsive Web Design from digital mock-ups to finished products.

The Go language is a new programming language for creating concurrent applications, high-load and high-responsive software services, and complex systems. The language supports totally re-thought concepts and paradigms of software development, unlike other programming languages.

"Building Your First Application with Go" is your way into the world of software development. Go has a robust library and advanced techniques. This makes it a great language that can even be understood by people with no experience in programming.

	
Businesses now have access to more data than ever before, and a key challenge is how to ensure that data can be easily accessed and used efficiently. MongoDB makes it possible to store and process large sets of data in ways that drive up business value. The flexibility of unstructured storage, combined with robust querying and post processing functionality, make MongoDB a compelling solution for enterprise big data needs.

Learning MongoDB will show you how to install, configure, and secure MongoDB to meet the demands of modern enterprise data systems. You will quickly master data management, queries, post processing, and essential enterprise redundancy requirements to achieve high availability and fast response times.

The course begins with installation instructions and moves on to the essential features, covering advanced data manipulation and high availability. Then, topics such as backup and recovery are covered. Advanced data analysis is demonstrated using both MapReduce and the MongoDB aggregation framework with clear diagrams and examples.

As we move to the end of the course, we delve into SSL security and programmatic access using various languages. You'll also learn about MongoDBâ€™s built-in redundancy and scale features, replica sets, and sharding.

This video course will take you on a journey from all the downright basics of MongoDB to the deployment of a reliable, secure, and enterprise-ready big data solution.
